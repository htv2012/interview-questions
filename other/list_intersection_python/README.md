# The Problem

Given three lists, return the intersection: a list of those items that
appear in all three. 

- Order matter
- As with interview questions, do not use library functions
- Lists are not sorted in any order

Example:

    [1 3 2 4] [2 3 4 6] [9 3 3 4 1] ==> [3 4]

# Solution

See intersection.py
