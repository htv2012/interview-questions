My Bags


I have a Tom Bihn [Daylight Briefcase 8L] in blue color which I really love. It fits my 14-inch laptop. This bag is very light, yet durable.

I also have a black Tom Bihn [Copilot 10L] which fits my 12-in Macbook. It is heavier than the Daylight, more rugged, but cannot hold my 14-inch laptop.

For short, out-and-about town, I carry a brown Tom Bihn [Small Cafe 5L] bag which can hold my medicine, Kindle eBook, and some small items. I like this bag for being very light, yet durable. This bag also can fit a 9.7-inch iPad in a thick neoprene sleeve.

I used to carry my 12-inch Macbook every where with me using a Timbuk2 messenger bag which I have long forgotten the model name. All I know if this bag could hold plenty of my stuff, but it could not fit the 14-inch Thinkpad

For my work commute, I used to use a Timbuk2 backpack. It has a laptop compartment which fits a 15-inch laptop; a feat which none of my Tom Bihnh bags could do. This bag is rain proof which is essential for Seattle weather. It has plenty of pockets for organization. The only negative I have with it is the inability to stand: the bag will topple forward if I leave it be. That means most of the time, I have to lean it to the wall, lay down flat, or hang on a hook; none of these positions are convenient for accessing its contents.

For my commute, I use the Tom Bihn [Synapse 25], which offers a little more room than the Timbuk2 backpack. While this bag itself is made with water proof materials, rain water can still seeps in at the zippers so I don't use it in the rain seasons.
