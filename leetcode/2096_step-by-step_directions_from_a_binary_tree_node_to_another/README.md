Hint
You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is
uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer
startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different
integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.

Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate
step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the
uppercase letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific
direction:

'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
Output: "UURL"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.


Example 2:


Input: root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1
Output: "L"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 2 → 1.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= Node.val <= n
All the values in the tree are unique.
1 <= startValue, destValue <= n
startValue != destValue

* Hint 1: The shortest path between any two nodes in a tree must pass
  through their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). The path will travel
  upwards from node s to the LCA and then downwards from the LCA to node
  t.
* Hint 2: Find the path strings from root → s, and root → t. Can you use
  these two strings to prepare the final answer?
* Hint 3: Remove the longest common prefix of the two path strings to
  get the path LCA → s, and LCA → t. Each step in the path of LCA → s
  should be reversed as 'U'.
